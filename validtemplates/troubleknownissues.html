<!--- Known issues articles help inform customers of issues that they may encounter that are currently being worked on or planned to be fixed in the near future. Known issues added to the article should be removed when the issue has been resolved. If the issue is never going to be resolved, it should be documented in a conceptual or how-to article as expected behavior.
